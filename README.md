Currently, I am studying Business and Data Analytics Course by Boston Consulting Group and will be graduating in Jan 2022. As part of the course, I worked with my team to find solution to solve real world business problems. And I am very excited to use data processing power to gain insights and improve the decision-making process.

Previously I was a teacher for 10 years and had taught over 1000 students till date. I constantly learn and incorporate technology in my teaching repertoire. It is invigorating to see students achieve the ah-ha moment especially through a use of a new technology teaching tools.
